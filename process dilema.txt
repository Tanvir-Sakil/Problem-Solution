Given n process ( P1, P2, P3, …., Pi…., Pn ). For every process Pi we will give you the following information:

The id of the process (Ii)
The time when the process appears (ai)
The total time to complete the process after the process start executing (ti)
Note that:

All process id will be unique.
The process which appears first will start executing first.
If two process appears at the same time, then process with less executing time will start executing first.
If 2 & 3 is same for some process, then process with lower id will start executing first.
No process will start executing before it’s previous process completed execution.
If a process start executing at time T and the total execution time for that process is ti, then the process will be completed at time T + ti -1.
Check the image in explanation section for more clarity.

You will be given m queries. In each query you will be given a time Qj, you have to print the id number of the running process that time. If there is no process running that time print -1.

Input Format

In the first line you will be given two integers n (Number of process) and m (Number of queries). In the next following n lines, each line describes a process information formatted as “Ii ai ti”. In the next line there will be an array Q containing m integers.

Constraints

1 <= n, m <= 3*105
1 <= Ii <= n
1 <= ai, ti <= 1012
1 <= Qj <= 1018

Output Format

For each query you have to print the id number of the executing process. If there is no process running that time, then print -1. After each query you have to print a space. See the sample I/O for better understanding.
